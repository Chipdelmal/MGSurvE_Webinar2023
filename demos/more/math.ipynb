    "# Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The default implementation of [MGSurvE](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE) assumes individuals traverse a landscape following \"random-walker\" behavior according to a movement matrix, $\\tau$, the entries of which, $\\tau_{ij}$, describe the probability of moving from population $i$ to population $j$ in one time step. Incorporating traps as absorbing states within this formulation allows us to calculate outcomes of interest, such as the mean time to absorption (i.e., being trapped) using the properties of absorbing Markov chains."

We determine the movement probability from any given site to any given trap based on the attractiveness profile, $\\hat{\\eta}$, and the trap-type attractiveness relative to the current mosquito resource, $\\phi(\\hat{s_i}, \\hat{t_j})$. Equations 4 and 5 are included to mathematically describe that traps are absorbing states:\n",

The latter case represents the worst case scenario."
