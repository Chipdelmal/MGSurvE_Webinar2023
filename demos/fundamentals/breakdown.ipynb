    "This structure is coded as a class within the MGSurvE framework and, in its most basic form, upon definition it takes care of preprocessing all the required substructures (the most important being the distance and migration matrices). Generating a simple landscape usually involves these steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  1. Load/[Generate](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.pointProcess.html#module-MGSurvE.pointProcess) pointset\n",
    "  2. Define mosquito [movement kernel](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.kernels.html#module-MGSurvE.kernels)\n",
    "  3. Define traps, [attractiveness kernels](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.kernels.html#module-MGSurvE.kernels) and [type-masking probability matrices](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/MGSurvE.html#MGSurvE.matrices.calcMaskedMigrationMatrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have tried to make the [Landscape](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.landscape.html#module-MGSurvE.landscape) class as flexible as possible and as such, there are several alternatives to the most simple cases. Some of these alternatives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Landscapes can be defined as [Euclidean](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/landscapeCreation.html) (xy) and [spherical](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/GA_STP.html) (longitude-latitude).\n",
    "  * Various distance functions can be used ([haversine](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/) is used by default on spherical landscapes, but [vincenty](https://pypi.org/project/vincenty/) can also be used).\n",
    "  * Migration matrices can be provided directly to the class (to allow for external computation).\n",
    "  * An attraction vector can be provided to make some sites to be visited more frequently relative to others.\n",

    "## [Optimization](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/GA.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform our optimization, MGSurvE's base implementation makes use of the [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) genetic algorithms package. The way this coupling operates is by extending some of the base operations in the framework (fitness, mutation, and crossover), and then allowing it to cycle through the possible solutions. In general, the required steps to follow for this section of our workflow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Select optimization type ([discrete](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/MGSurvE.html#MGSurvE.optimization.optimizeDiscreteTrapsGA) or [continuous](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/MGSurvE.html#MGSurvE.optimization.optimizeTrapsGA))\n",
    "  2. Select [GA operators](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.optimization.html#module-MGSurvE.optimization) (mutation, crossover, selection)\n",
    "  3. Select or define [fitness function](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.optimization.html#module-MGSurvE.optimization)\n",
    "  4. Run the [optimization process](https://chipdelmal.github.io/MGSurvE/build/html/generated/MGSurvE.optimization.html#module-MGSurvE.optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "This step also involves a high level of flexibility to allow for better optimization results and further extensions to the base applications, some examples being:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The ability to mark traps as immovable.\n",
    "  * Option to provide custom-made operations for mutation, crossover, or selection.\n",
    "  * Flexibility to define alternative fitness functions.\n",
