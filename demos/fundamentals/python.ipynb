    "Some important things for [R](https://www.r-project.org) programmers who are new to [Python](https://www.python.org/) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In line with most programming languages, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is **zero-indexed**, meaning that arrays, lists, and other collections start from index `0` rather than `1`.\n",
    "* In contrast to most other programming languages, [Python](https://www.python.org/) **does not use brackets for code-blocks rather, it uses indentation** to delimit sections of our code for functions and logic structures. While it might seem strange the first couple of times it's used, people who are used to following code-style practices will quickly get used to the idea.\n",
    "* Semi colons (`;`) are not necessary to end lines, but they can be used to do multiple commands in one line.\n",
    "* Multiple variables can be assigned in the same line through \"unpacking\": `(a, b, c) = (10, 4, 2)` (see the [\"tuples section\"](#tuple) for more information).\n",
    "* Lists are mutable and copies have to be done explicitly to avoid inadvertenly changing the values of elements by reference (see [lists](#list) section for more information).\n",
    "* Growing lists in [Python](https://www.python.org/) is not as computationally expensive as it is in R (due to [amortized list expansion](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/amortized-runtime-analysis-for-python-lists-35e935e290db)).\n",
    "* Logic comparisons are done with `==`, whereas comparing memory elements is done with `is` (for more info have a look at the [\"boolean\" section](#boolean)).\n",
    "* Snake-casing is preferred over other types of words separators for variable names (such as camel-casing), and using the `.` usually results in errors as it is an operator to access attributes or methods in objects (see the [objects section](#objects) for more info).\n",
    "* Array and matrix operations are done under an external library (see [Numpy section](#arrays-and-matrices-numpy) for more info).\n",
    "* Array and matrix objects are static in size and homogeneous in data type (see [Numpy section](#arrays-and-matrices-numpy) for more information).\n",
    "* Array and matrix objects are modified \"in-place\", so copies of the objects have to be explicitly requested in order to modify different sections of memory (see [Numpy section](#arrays-and-matrices-numpy) for more information)."

    "Virtual Environments are strongly suggested for anyone who does development in [Python](https://www.python.org/). This is because they help solve a lot of problems with packages dependencies, making the code reproducible, and installing packages in systems where we don't have admin privileges. Learning what are and how to use virtual environments is outside the scope of this quick guide (as throughout the webinar we will be working with a Docker image that already contains all the required dependencies to run the code), but the main idea of these tools is to create isolated \"versions\" of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) language and packages required to run a specific application so that several different versions can co-exist in the same system. For more info on working with virtual environments, have a look at these guides: [venv](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) and [conda](https://whiteboxml.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-python-virtual-environments-with-conda)"
