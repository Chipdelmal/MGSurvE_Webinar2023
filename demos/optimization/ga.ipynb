    "Genetic Algorithms borrow inspiration from biological inheritance processes to attempt to solve optimization problems by generating a \"population\" of possible solutions (chromosomes) from which the most \"fit\" are selected for mating and mutation. By iterating this process over generations we expect the population to slowly converge upon the most \"fit\" region of our problem space which would correspond to the solution to the optimization task."

To do this, the positions of the traps are encoded into the chromosomes of the populations in pairs of alleles as follows:\n",

Once we have set the position of our traps we can calculate our fitness metric ($\\phi$ in this case) by computing the time it would take for a random walker to fall into a trap given the current setup (more on this in the [following section](#fitness)).
