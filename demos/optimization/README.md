# Optimization

Probably the most dense section of our webinar. We will go through the basics of Genetic Algorithms and how they interface with MGSurvE. Some knowledge of constrained optimization problems and techniques to solve them would be good to have, although not strictly necessary as a brief introduction on GA will be covered in the session.
